		The LRU caching scheme is to remove the least recently used frame when the cache is full and a new page is referenced 
		which is not there in cache.
		We use two data structures to implement an LRU Cache.  
		Queue - The maximum size of the queue will be equal to the total number of frames available (cache size). The most recently used pages will 
		be near front end and least recently pages will be near the rear end.
		A Hash with page number as key and address of the corresponding queue node as value.
